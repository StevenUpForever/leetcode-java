     * 751. IP to CIDR
     * Given a start IP address ip and a number of ips we need to cover n, return a representation of the range as a list (of smallest possible length) of CIDR blocks.
     *
     * A CIDR block is a string consisting of an IP, followed by a slash, and then the prefix length. For example: "123.45.67.89/20". That prefix length "20" represents the number of common prefix bits in the specified range.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: ip = "255.0.0.7", n = 10
     * Output: ["255.0.0.7/32","255.0.0.8/29","255.0.0.16/32"]
     * Explanation:
     * The initial ip address, when converted to binary, looks like this (spaces added for clarity):
     * 255.0.0.7 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000111
     * The address "255.0.0.7/32" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
     * ie. just this one address.
     *
     * The address "255.0.0.8/29" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 29 bits to the given address:
     * 255.0.0.8 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
     * Addresses with common prefix of 29 bits are:
     * 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
     * 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001001
     * 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001010
     * 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001011
     * 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001100
     * 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001101
     * 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001110
     * 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001111
     *
     * The address "255.0.0.16/32" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
     * ie. just 11111111 00000000 00000000 00010000.
     *
     * In total, the answer specifies the range of 10 ips starting with the address 255.0.0.7 .
     *
     * There were other representations, such as:
     * ["255.0.0.7/32","255.0.0.8/30", "255.0.0.12/30", "255.0.0.16/32"],
     * but our answer was the shortest possible.
     *
     * Also note that a representation beginning with say, "255.0.0.7/30" would be incorrect,
     * because it includes addresses like 255.0.0.4 = 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000100
     * that are outside the specified range.
     * Note:
     * ip will be a valid IPv4 address.
     * Every implied address ip + x (for x < n) will be a valid IPv4 address.
     * n will be an integer in the range [1, 1000].

    /*
    Solution:
    1. combine ip address to an integer
    2. loop until range is filled
        2.1 find the rightmost 1 by x & -x
        2.2 right shift the 1 to <= current range, means fill with shortest prefix as much as possible
        2.3 convert current x append with length to res
        2.4 increase x by step to next possible shortest prefix
        2.5 minus steps in range so that we know how much range left
